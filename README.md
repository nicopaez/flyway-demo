# Flyway Demo

This repository contains a set of samples to demostrate the usage of FlywayDB to implement a versioning and automation strategy for database evolution.

At the moment the two samples are included: one for PostgreSQL and another one for SQL Server. Each sample brings a docker compose setup to simplify experimentation.

[This short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E54DaLKEFc) (in Spanish) explains in ~7 minutes the basic usage of Flyway (the video was recorded a couple of years ago so it may show some not-up-to-date staff).
